INSTALLATION

# create .rvmrc file with the following code:

rvm ree-1.8.7-2012.02@pha --create


# downgrade rubygems

gem update --system 1.8.25 (Kuba: I had to do it)

# install gems

gem install rails -v=1.2.6
gem install rake -v=0.8.7


# to use gems from vendor/gems add the following code into environment.rb

config.load_paths += Dir["#{RAILS_ROOT}/vendor/gems/**"].map do |dir|
  File.directory?(lib = "#{dir}/lib") ? lib : dir
end

or

export RAILS_ENV='development'


# create database.yml, example:

development:
  adapter: mysql
  encoding: utf8
  database: pha_development
  username: root
  password:
  host: localhost


#create database and load schema

As migration script were broken as of 2014-10-22. Use dump that reflects state of dba at 107_add_fields_to_partners.rb.
To set up your env load db/dumps/pha_2014-10-22.sql. From now on migrations should be run.

You can use script/reload-and-migrate-db to clear and repopulate your db from dump.

export RAILS_ENV='development'; ./script/reload-db
