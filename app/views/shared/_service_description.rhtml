<p class="clear"><a name="npln"></a><h2>National Pension Lawyers Network (NPLN):</h2>The NPLN is a nationwide lawyer referral service operated by the Pension Action Center at the University of Massachusetts Boston. The service is free-of-charge for clients and for attorney members. NPLN will conduct a brief intake with the client, and then make a referral to a lawyer skilled in employee benefit claims, fiduciary litigation or the division of pensions at divorce, as appropriate. Referral lawyers may charge for their services, but are encouraged to offer reduced or sliding-scale fees, based on client need.</p>

Both services are free for clients and for actuary members. The applicable service will conduct a brief intake with the client, and then make a referral to an appropriately skilled actuary. Member actuaries may charge for their services, but are encouraged to offer reduced-fee, sliding-scale or pro bono services as appropriate, based on client need.</p>

<p><a name="search_net"></a><h2>PensionSearch Network:</h2>Experienced lawyers, actuaries and other pension professionals are needed to help reconnect deferred vested participants and their beneficiaries with the benefits they earned while working at companies they cannot locate. Certain plans are particularly difficult for individuals to find: defined benefit plans that terminated prior to July 1, 1974; terminated defined contribution plans; and any qualified plan that has undergone a change in plan name, sponsor name, or any other change in plan or corporate form. Members will be notified by email of any sponsors or plans that we are unable to find through standard investigative means. Inquiries will be based on your subject matter and geographic experience. If you know something about the plan or sponsor, simply reply to our e-mail.</p>
