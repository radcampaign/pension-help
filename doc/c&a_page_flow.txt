page 1:
- emp type
- state, county, city if emp_type 6,7,8

page 2:
add to zip:
- 3 state questions - prepopulated if emp_type 6, 7, 8
- skip work_state if emp_type 6,7,8

Check for counseling.matching_agencies (this will include AoA or DSPs if applicable)

Page 3:
show only if emp_type 6,7,8
- show all matching plans, allow user to pick one
- if user picks "don't know", show employees_list and ask them to pick

Keep track of selected plan.

Page 4: 
- check if any restrictions exist on the matching_agencies or dsps
- if any exist, ask the appropriate questions (age, income, start/end date)
- if we need to, ask any necessary questions about TSP, pension-earner, divorce/survivorship

Submit any new age/income/date restrictions and get new list of matching_agencies

Results:
- loop through matching_agencies.
- show agency.best_location for each one.

If you pick a plan, then age/income/date restriction may preclude your eligibility.
We show this plan anyway. is this right?

Can we move age to same page as other DSP stuff?
